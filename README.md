# dotfiles m1

### Prerequisites

* You need to have `git` installed on your machine. For MacOS:

```sh
xcode-select --install
```

* Ensure you haven't installed any additional programs, e.g. Google Chrome.

  This will interfere with the setup script and cause it to fail.

### Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/thomashexton/dotfiles-m1.git ~/dotfiles-m1
cd ~/dotfiles-m1
./setup
```
